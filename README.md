# COMP3480 Lab 1 - Introduction

This project is a beginner friendly FastAPI service created as a programming lab assignment. The main goal is to learn how to build an API service using Python and the FastAPI framework. 

## Project Purpose

- Learn to design and implement API endpoints
- Practice using query strings, path parameters, and POST requests with FastAPI
- Understand documentation in APIs (/docs)
- Demonstrate the ability to handle different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST)

## Features

- 10 API routes: Showcasing path, query, and POST usage
- Simple mathematical operations: Routes to add, cube, and compute factorials
- User data handling: Accepts and processes JSON inputs through POST
